Hi team,

On [date] at [time] in [location], we're going to be doing a workshop on test-driven development (TDD). This is a live coding workshop, so you'll need the following materials installed on your computer. Please make sure you've installed them before the workshop starts so we can make the most of our time.

**Git**

To check if you have Git installed, run `git --version` from the command-line. If it isn't installed, you can download Git from [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/).

**Node.js**

To check if you have Node.js installed, run `node --version` from the command-line. If it isn't installed, you can download Node from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).

**Example repository**

Clone the source code repository by running `git clone https://github.com/jamesshore/tdd-intro.git` from the command-line. Then check if everything worked by following these steps:

1. Change directories into the example repo: `cd tdd-intro`
2. Check out the 'start-here' branch: `git checkout start-here`
3. Run the build:
	a. On Mac: `./build.sh`
	b. On Windows: `build`

For a short four-minute video explaining the workshop and demonstrating how to set up the example repository, see [https://www.letscodejavascript.com/v3/comments/tdd_intro/2](https://www.letscodejavascript.com/v3/comments/tdd_intro/2).

Thanks, and I'll see you there!
